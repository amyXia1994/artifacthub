    documentation: >-
      Pods which don't specify at least resource requests are assigned a QoS class
      of BestEffort which can hog resources for other Pods on Nodes. At a minimum,
      all Pods should specify resource requests in order to be labeled as the QoS
      class Burstable. This sample mutates any container in a Pod which doesn't
      specify memory or cpu requests to apply some sane defaults.
