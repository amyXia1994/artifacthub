    documentation: >-
      Many Kubernetes installations by default have a system:aggregate-to-edit
      ClusterRole which does not properly restrict access to editing Endpoints.
      This ConstraintTemplate forbids the system:aggregate-to-edit ClusterRole
      from granting permission to create/patch/update Endpoints.

      ClusterRole/system:aggregate-to-edit should not allow
      Endpoint edit permissions due to CVE-2021-25740, Endpoint & EndpointSlice
      permissions allow cross-Namespace forwarding,
